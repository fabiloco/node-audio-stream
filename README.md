# ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¿ Simple nodejs database
This is a simple example of a database which stores audio with the stream module. I'm planning to use something like this for a music player project.

### node packages
The node packages used in this project are the followings:

- express: A node framework to create web servers
- mongodb: mongodb connection driver
- cors: to connecte this server with other servers
- multer: to upload audio to the server
- morgan: to see the http petitions

```
npm i express mongodb cors multer morgan -D
```
